## Readings: CSS Layout

### Answers

#### Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

   - It means it excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.
  
2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

   - The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property, either row or column.
   - The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column.
  
3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

   - Properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document, such as row-reverse and column-reverse values, can negatively impact accessibility. The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order, and this is important as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content.

#### CSS Layout - Flexbox

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

   - An element with float set on it is taken out of the normal layout flow of the document and stuck to a specified  side of its parent container. Any content that would come below the floated element in the normal layout flow will now look odd.

2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

   - It is important to understand CSS in most dev jobs, but particularly so as a front-end dev. I feel I have been most comfortable undertaking front-end work in the past, and have been complimented on my creativity when it comes to programming in the past, so at present I feel I am likely to focus on front-end/design (UX) work in future.
