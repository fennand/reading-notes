2. What is a JavaScript function?

   - A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task, which is defined by the *function* keyword. It is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
     
3. What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?

   - It means the code will then be executed. This is can be done by an event happening on the page (like a click), or when it is called in the code with the () operator.
     
4. What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function.

   - They are for including the parameters of the function. When they are empty in the call of the function (called the () operator), they are for invoking the function.
