1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

   - Events are when something happens on the page a user is on. These can be things like clicking a mouse on something, or even just a page loading.
  
2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

   - We have the type of event, such as a *click*. And we also have the function we want to call when the event happens.
  
3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

   - An event object is a parameter specified with a name such as *event* inside an event handler function, which is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information.
  
4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

   - In event bubbling, the event movement begins from the target to the outermost element in the file. Capturing is the opposite, where an event moves from the outermost element to the target.
