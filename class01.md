# Class 01 - Learning Markdown

1. What is Markdown?
- Essentially Markdown is an easy way to make a plaintext document look a bit jazzy! It is a relatively simple way to just write out some text, then add a bit of formatting (adding the odd mark here and there) to mark up the text and make it look more presentable (while still being usable in it's original form)

2. Why do we use Markdown?
- It is everywhere! Lots of desktop and web-based applications support it, and big websites like Reddit and GitHub support it as well
- It is portable, which basically means most applications can open it. This just means you are not stuck using an application you do not like. For example, if you use Microsoft Word to create a document, it can then be difficult to open that document in another application, and it can look weird if it does open!
- It is futureproof, there will always be a text editing application that will be able to read Markdown
- It can create and run Markdown on any operating system

3. What symbol will create a heading in Markdown? How many do you need to create the largest heading? How many do you need to create the smallest heading?
- We use the # symbol to create a heading, with one used for the largest heading, and the smallest heading uses six.
# Heading One
## Heading Two
### Heading Three
#### Heading Four
##### Heading Five
###### Heading Six

4. When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?
- To make text bold, we use two *'s on either end of the word/words we want to make **bold**. To make text italicized, we use one *'s on either end of the word/words we want to make *italicized*. We could also use underscores, however best practice is to use an asterix as some applications cannot handle an underscore in the middle of a word.

5. How do you create a link with Markdown?
- To create a link, we put the link text in square brackets and then immediately follow this with the URL in curved brackets. [Example](https://fennand.github.io/reading-notes/)

6. What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?
- The three symbols that can be used are a dash (-), an asterix (*), or a plus sign (+).
