### Getting Started

1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

   - First you direct your browser to look up a URL
   - Then your browser will look up an IP, and does it so well
   - Next your browser sends a request of HTTP
   - And then the host sends back a response, really quickly
   - The last step is the browser rendering the response
   - And that's how you'd describe this process like a poetic renaissance
  
2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

   - Parsing is the step the browser takes to turn the data it receives over the network into the DOM and CSSOM, which is used by the renderer to paint a page to the screen. The browser recognises any links such as < sript > or < link > and will then parse them in the order of HTML, CSS, and then Javascript.
  
3. How can you find images to add to a Website?

   - By using a search engine
  
4. How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?

   - A string has to be in '', a number does not
  
5. What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

   - Variables are containers that store values. They are impportant as they are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalise a greeting message or change an image displayed in an image gallery.
